# Notif Priming Redesign — "Two Kinds of Nudges"

**Status:** approved by user, ready for implementation
**Target file:** `MindRestore/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingNewScreens.swift` — replaces the body of `OnboardingNotificationPrimingView` (lines 652–844)
**New asset:** `MindRestore/Assets.xcassets/app-icon.imageset/` (copy of `AppIcon-1024.png`)

## Goal

Replace the current generic "bell icon + 3 SF Symbol bullets + gradient button" treatment with a brand-aligned visual that converts the system permission prompt at 70-80% instead of the typical cold ~40%. The page sells the value of notifications BEFORE the system dialog fires by literally showing what Memo's notifications look like vs the algorithmic feed's.

## Concept

**Two stacked iOS-lock-screen notification cards** as the hero. Top card is a faded, slightly tilted TikTok engagement-bait notification (what the user is escaping). Bottom card is a bright Memo notification reflecting the actual Focus Mode reward loop the user just set up on the page before. Same app (TikTok) named on both notifications — Memo doesn't ban TikTok, Memo gives it back on the user's terms.

## Layout

```
┌─ progress header (existing) ─────────┐

   eyebrow:   TWO KINDS OF NUDGES

   headline:  One pulls you in.
              One pulls you out.

   caption: The feed nudges to harvest you.
            Memo nudges to give you time back.

   🔒 No spam. Once a day max.

   [    Let Memo nudge me    ]

              Not now
```

No connector glyph between cards — they breathe.

## Notification card visual spec

Both cards: 22pt corner radius, 14pt horizontal padding, 14pt vertical padding, full-width inside the page's 24pt horizontal page padding.

### Feed card (TikTok)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `OB.surface` |
| Border | `Color.white.opacity(0.06)`, 1pt |
| Icon | `Image("logo-tiktok")` at 38pt rounded square (corner radius 9) |
| App name | "TikTok" — `.brand(size: 14, weight: .heavy)` in `OB.fg2` |
| Timestamp | "now" — `.brand(size: 12, weight: .medium)` in `OB.fg3` |
| Body | "🔥 Your For You page is moving. Come see what you missed." — `.brand(size: 14, weight: .medium)` in `OB.fg2`, 2-line clip |
| Whole card | `.opacity(0.55)`, `.rotationEffect(-3°)`, `.scaleEffect(0.97)` |
| Shadow | none |

### Memo card

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `OB.surface` with overlay `OB.accent.opacity(0.05)` |
| Border | `OB.accent.opacity(0.35)`, 1.5pt |
| Icon | `Image("app-icon")` at 38pt rounded square (corner radius 9) |
| App name | "Memo" — `.brand(size: 14, weight: .heavy)` in `OB.fg`. v2.0 rename ("Memo - Doomscroll Blocker" on the App Store) sets `CFBundleDisplayName` to "Memo" for the home-screen / notification surface. The mockup matches the post-rename state since v2.0 ships with the rename. |
| Timestamp | "now" — `.brand(size: 12, weight: .medium)` in `OB.fg3` |
| Body | "You earned 12 min of TikTok. Tap to unlock." — `.brand(size: 14, weight: .heavy)` in `OB.fg`, 2-line clip. |
| Whole card | full opacity, `.rotationEffect(+1°)` |
| Shadow | `OB.accent.opacity(0.32)`, radius 24, y 10 |

Card spacing: 18pt vertical gap between the two cards. Cards do NOT visually overlap.

## Copy

| Slot | Copy |
|---|---|
| Eyebrow | `TWO KINDS OF NUDGES` |
| Headline | `One pulls you in.\nOne pulls you out.` (38pt, heavy, rounded design, `OB.fg`) |
| Feed app name | `TikTok` |
| Feed body | `🔥 Your For You page is moving. Come see what you missed.` |
| Memo app name | `Memo` |
| Memo body | `You earned 12 min of TikTok. Tap to unlock.` |
| Caption | `The feed nudges to pull you back. Memo nudges to give you time back.` (15pt, semibold, `OB.fg2`) |
| Privacy line | `🔒 No spam. Just unlocks, streak saves, and patrol reminders.` (12pt, semibold, `OB.fg3`) |
| Primary CTA | `Let Memo nudge me` (via `OBContinueButton`) |
| Skip button | `Not now` (subhead, semibold, `OB.fg2`) |
| Denied state caption | `Permission was denied earlier — open Settings to enable.` |
| Denied state CTA | `Open Settings` |
| Timeout state caption | `Couldn't request permission. Tap to retry.` (`OB.coral`) |
| Timeout state CTA | `Try Again` |

## Entrance animation

| t | Action |
|---|---|
| 0.10s | Eyebrow + headline fade in (`opacity 0→1`, `offset y 8→0`, 0.4s easeOut) |
| 0.40s | Feed card slides in from above (`offset y -40→0`, `opacity 0→0.55`, 0.5s spring response 0.55, damping 0.82) |
| 0.75s | Memo card slides up from below (`offset y 30→0`, `opacity 0→1`, 0.55s spring response 0.5, damping 0.78). On animation completion, fire `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()` |
| 1.20s | Caption + privacy line fade in (0.35s easeOut) |
| 1.45s | CTA + skip button fade up |

Total entrance ≈ 1.5s — matches Differentiation pacing.

## Behavior preserved (must not change)

The redesign is a pure visual refactor. All existing behavior in `OnboardingNotificationPrimingView` stays intact:

- 8s timeout race against the system permission prompt
- `previouslyDenied` detection via `UNUserNotificationCenter.current().notificationSettings()` on appear
- Settings deep-link branch when previously denied
- `onResult: (Bool) -> Void` callback contract (parent advances on either outcome)
- Analytics events fire on the same triggers: `notificationsEnabled`, `notificationsDeclined`, `notificationsTimeout`, `notificationsSkipped`
- `permissionTask` cancellation on disappear
- The retry / timeout error flow

The state variables `headlineAppeared`, `bulletsAppeared`, `requesting`, `permissionTask`, `showTimeoutError`, `previouslyDenied` are renamed/refined as needed for the new animation timeline, but the permission flow logic is byte-for-byte preserved.

## Component scope

Two private views, file-local in `OnboardingNewScreens.swift` (NOT extracted to `Components/`):

```swift
private struct NotifMockupCard: View {
    enum Variant { case feed, memo }
    let variant: Variant
    let appIcon: Image
    let appName: String
    let body: String
    // body: builds the card according to variant
}
```

No new files. No changes to `MonoKeypad`, `OBContinueButton`, `OBEyebrow`, or any shared component. The font extension `.brand(size:weight:)` already exists.

## New asset

Create `MindRestore/Assets.xcassets/app-icon.imageset/`:

- `Contents.json` — standard imageset descriptor pointing at the PNG
- `app-icon.png` — copy of `MindRestore/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png`

Imagesets do not need to be registered in `project.pbxproj` because the `.xcassets` folder is a folder reference (verified via `grep -c "logo-tiktok\|mascot-thinking\.imageset" project.pbxproj` returning 0 — none of the existing imagesets are individually tracked).

## App Review safety

The TikTok mockup card uses the real `logo-tiktok` asset and the literal string "TikTok". This is consistent with how competitor apps (Opal, Brick, ScreenZen) handle similar comparison screens, and matches Apple's allowance for nominative trademark use in legitimate comparative context. The risk is mitigated by:

1. **Heavy illustrative styling** — `-3°` rotation, 0.55 opacity, 0.97 scale make the card visibly a stylized mockup, not a forged system notification
2. **Surrounding context** — the page header explicitly frames both cards as illustrative ("TWO KINDS OF NUDGES" / "One pulls you in. One pulls you out.")
3. **No deceptive claims** — the feed copy is generic feed-bait, not an attempt to spoof TikTok branding

If App Review pushes back, the fallback is a generic "feed app" treatment: replace the TikTok logo with a stylized red-gradient app icon and the name "Social Feed" or similar. Branded version is the preferred ship target.

## Future enhancement: dynamic Memo app name

Memori cannot read app names from `FamilyActivitySelection.applicationTokens` — Apple deliberately treats those as opaque privacy tokens. The token count is accessible (`activitySelection.applicationTokens.count`) but the names are not.

To make the Memo card show the user's actual most-blocked app, we'd need an upstream signal:

- **Option A:** Add a one-tap "what's your worst app?" pick to an earlier onboarding page (Goals or Pain Cards), with a fixed list (TikTok / Instagram / Snapchat / YouTube / X / Reddit). Map the answer through to this mockup.
- **Option B:** Defer dynamic app name to v2.1+ when a "primary blocked app" preference exists in `FocusModeService`.

For v2.0 ship: hardcode "TikTok" on both cards. The `NotifMockupCard` view should accept the app name + icon as parameters so the dynamic version is a one-line swap when the upstream signal exists.

## Out of scope

- No changes to the actual notification copy/scheduling in `NotificationService.swift`. The "Memo earned you X min of TikTok" notification on the mockup is illustrative — production notifications are governed by the existing 8 notification types and may not match this exact copy verbatim.
- No changes to `OnboardingView.swift` page wiring — the parent still presents `OnboardingNotificationPrimingView { granted in ... }` with the same callback.
- No changes to the page's position in the flow (still page 14 between Focus Mode and Commitment).

## Acceptance criteria

1. Build succeeds via `xcodebuild ... -destination 'id=00008130-000A214E11E2001C'`
2. Both light + dark mode render correctly (page is dark-pinned via `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)` like sibling pages)
3. Granting permission via the system prompt still fires `Analytics.onboardingStep(step: "notificationsEnabled")` and calls `onResult(true)`
4. Declining still fires `notificationsDeclined` + `onResult(false)`
5. Timeout still fires `notificationsTimeout` and shows the retry CTA
6. Skip via "Not now" still fires `notificationsSkipped` and calls `onResult(false)`
7. Previously-denied state surfaces "Open Settings" CTA that deep-links to `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString`
8. Entrance animation does not block CTA — buttons are tappable from the moment they appear
9. The Memo card icon is the actual Memo app icon (loaded from `Image("app-icon")`)
10. The TikTok card icon is the existing `logo-tiktok` asset

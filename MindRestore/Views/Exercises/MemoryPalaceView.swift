//  Research basis:
//  - Dresler et al. 2017 (Neuron) — 6 weeks of method of loci training
//    produced durable improvements in memory performance.
//  - Maguire et al. 2003 — 90% of memory champions use this technique.
//  - The method of loci is the single most effective memory training
//    technique in the literature, leveraging the brain's powerful
//    spatial memory system.
